# Siri phrases for WalkyTrails (hands-free)

Use these phrases **after you've started a walk** in the app (tap "Start Walk" once, then put the phone away). Siri will add the event to your current walk so you don't have to touch the screen.

---

## Setup (do this first)

Siri often won't understand until the shortcut is "known" to your device. Do **one** of the following:

### Option A – Add to Siri (most reliable)

1. Open the **Shortcuts** app (built into iOS).
2. Tap **+** (New Shortcut) or open **Gallery** / **App Shortcuts**.
3. Search for **WalkyTrails** or scroll to **App Shortcuts** and find **Log pee**, **Log poop**, **Log water**, **Log play**.
4. Tap **Log pee** (or any one) → tap **Add Shortcut**.
5. Open the shortcut, tap the **•••** menu → **Add to Siri**.
6. Record your phrase (e.g. "Log pee") and save. Repeat for **Log poop**, **Log water**, **Log play** if you want.
7. After that, "Hey Siri" + your recorded phrase will run the shortcut.

### Option B – Run once from Shortcuts

1. Open **Shortcuts** → find **WalkyTrails** shortcuts (**Log pee**, **Log poop**, etc.).
2. Run **Log pee** once (tap it). No need to have a walk started when testing.
3. Sometimes Siri then recognizes "Hey Siri, run Log pee" or "Hey Siri, Log pee" after the shortcut has been used.

### Option C – Ask Siri to "run" the shortcut

Try: **"Hey Siri, run Log pee"** or **"Hey Siri, run WalkyTrails Log pee"**. Some devices respond better to "run" + the shortcut name.

## Before you start (each walk)

1. **Start a walk in the app**  
   Open WalkyTrails → tap **Start Walk**. You can then lock the phone or put it in your pocket.

2. **Say "Hey Siri"** (or use your usual Siri trigger)  
   Then say one of the phrases below.

## What to say (recommended – clear and distinct)

| To log… | Say this (pick one) |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Pee**  | "Hey Siri, **log pee**" or "Hey Siri, **log pee in WalkyTrails**" |
| **Poop** | "Hey Siri, **log poop**" or "Hey Siri, **log poop in WalkyTrails**" |
| **Water** | "Hey Siri, **log water**" or "Hey Siri, **log water in WalkyTrails**" |
| **Play** | "Hey Siri, **log play**" or "Hey Siri, **log play in WalkyTrails**" |

- **Short:** "Log pee", "Log poop", "Log water", "Log play"  
- **With "run":** "Hey Siri, run Log pee" (often works after Setup)  
- **With app name (less mix-ups):** "Log pee in WalkyTrails", "WalkyTrails log poop", etc.

---

## Why these phrases

- **One word after "log"** – pee, poop, water, play – so Siri is less likely to mishear.
- **"Log"** is short and different from "poop"/"pee", so you're less likely to log the wrong event.
- **"In WalkyTrails"** (optional) helps if you have other apps that use similar commands.

## If Siri says "No walk in progress"

You need to **start a walk in the app first**. Siri can only add events to a walk that's already started. Open WalkyTrails → tap **Start Walk** → then use Siri.

---

## Ending the walk

**End the walk in the app** (tap "End Walk" on the during-walk screen). Siri does not end the walk; that keeps you from accidentally ending it by voice.

---

## Siri doesn't understand?

1. **Do the Setup above** (Option A is the most reliable – "Add to Siri" with your own phrase).
2. Try **"Hey Siri, run Log pee"** (with "run").
3. Say the **app name** clearly: **"Hey Siri, log pee in WalkyTrails"** (say "Walky Trails" or "WalkyTrails").
4. **Quiet environment** – try indoors first so Siri isn't confused by wind or traffic.
5. **Check Siri & Search** – Settings → Siri & Search → scroll to **WalkyTrails** and make sure "Use with Ask Siri" (or similar) is on.
